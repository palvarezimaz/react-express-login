# Hi there!
This is a React-Express login exercise done in 2 hours, as part of a coding challenge.

## A few comments on the design choices

- The login quite simple, with just one user, with no DB, no Sessions nor several users.
- I've managed the styling using css files instead of incode styles, to make it quicker

### Detected problems or shortcomings

- The general CSS layout is not properly right. My main problem was to keep the login area centered, and a full black panel against the size of the image. I just need a little bit more time to fix this one
- The 'Welcome' of the login area should be white with a black border. I couldn't manage to do that one during the allocated time.

## Steps for installation

- Run npm i on each directory.
- Run server using npm run dev (for autoreload)
- Run client with npm start
- Server runs on port 3001, Client on 3000. It has been proxied.
